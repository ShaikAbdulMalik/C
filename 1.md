To day i leaarned about comment and escape commands

~There are mainly two types of comments:

1) "//" this is used for a single line of sentence for    character.

2) "*//*" this used for many lines of comments and multiple comments can be added.

~There arre many escape commands but only two of them are commonly used they are:

1) "\n" forward slash 'n' is used to send the sentence to the next line 

2) "\t" this is used to create spacing in between characters for example:(Shaik    Abdul       Malik)

Part 2:
Variables:

There are mainly Four types of Variable which are later broadly expanded:

1) int - integer (0,1,2,3,4....)(format specifer is '%d')

2) float - floating decimal points(1.232332)till 'six' decimal points (format specifier is '%f')

3) char - used to decalare a single char into the code (A,B,C,D....)(format specifier is '%c')(but it can also display -127 to +127 the format specifier is %d)('see more about asci values').

4) char[] - char used with array is used to declare many characters since in C language there is no concept of oops and strings can't be declared...Therefor char[] is used to declare many characters (Abdul Malik)(format specifier is '%s' )

part 3:
more variables:

5) double- it is more precise then float because it has more precision theen float 

6) boolean- to include bool code in your you should first include <stdbool.h> in your preprocessor command.This function allows you return whether thee gien condition is true or false.

7) char- 1byte (-128 to +127)(format specifier is either %d or %c)

8) unsigned char- 2bytes (0 to +255) (format specifier is either %c or %d)

9) short int- 2bytes (-32,768 to +32,768) (the format specifier for this is %d)

10) unsigned short int- 2bytes(0 to +65,535)(the format specifer is %d)

11) int- 4bytes (-2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,648) (the format specifier is %d)

12) unsigned int- 4bytes (0 to +4,294,967,295) (the format specifier is %u)

13) long long int- 8bytes (-9 quintillon to +9 quintillion) (the format specifier is %lld)

14) unsigned long long int- 8bytes (0 to +18 quintillion)(the format specifer is %llu)
